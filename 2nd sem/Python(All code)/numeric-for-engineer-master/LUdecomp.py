## module LUdecomp
''' a = LUdecomp(a).
    LU decomposition: [L][U] = [a]. The returned matrix [a] = [L\U]
    contains [U] in the upper triangle and the nondiagonal terms
    of [L] in the lower triangle.

    x = LUsolve(a,b).
    Solves [L][U]{x} = b, where [a] = [L\U] is the matrix returned
    from LUdecomp.
